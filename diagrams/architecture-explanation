# Data Center Architecture 

## Overview
This diagram represents a basic data center server deployment.
It shows how a Linux server connects to network infrastructure
to reach internal and external networks.

## Components Explained

### DC-Server-01
- Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS
- Static IP: 10.0.2.15
- Network Interface: enp0s3
- Provides application or service workloads

### Network Interface Card (NIC)
- Physical or virtual Ethernet interface
- Connects server to the data center network
- Supports Layer 2 and Layer 3 communication

### Top-of-Rack (ToR) Switch
- Aggregates server connections within a rack
- Handles VLAN segmentation
- Forwards traffic upstream

### Gateway
- Routes traffic outside the server VLAN
- Default route for external communication

### Firewall
- Applies security policies
- Controls inbound and outbound traffic

### Internet
- External network access
- Used for updates, remote access, and services

## Traffic Flow
1. Server sends traffic via NIC
2. Ethernet cable carries traffic to ToR switch
3. Switch forwards traffic based on VLAN rules
4. Gateway routes traffic externally
5. Firewall enforces security policies
6. Traffic reaches the internet

## Lab Context
This architecture is simulated using VirtualBox networking
to reflect real-world data center design principles.
